## RAG System

The RAG (Red-Amber-Green) system is a project management tool used to provide a visual representation of the status of various tasks or projects. Each color represents a different status:

- **Red**: Indicates that the task or project is in critical condition and requires immediate attention.
- **Amber**: Indicates that the task or project is experiencing some issues but is under control.
- **Green**: Indicates that the task or project is on track and progressing as planned.

This system helps teams quickly identify and address issues, ensuring that projects stay on schedule and within scope.
