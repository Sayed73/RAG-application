## RAG System

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system is a method used in natural language processing to enhance the generation of text by incorporating relevant information retrieved from external sources. This approach combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models:

- **Retrieval**: The system first retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query.
- **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is then used to augment the input, providing additional context and details.
- **Generation**: Finally, a generative model uses the augmented input to produce a more accurate and contextually relevant response.

This system helps improve the quality and relevance of generated text, making it particularly useful for tasks such as question answering, summarization, and conversational agents.
